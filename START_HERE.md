📖 **Read and follow**: `DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

This will:

- ✅ Create all 8 required database tables
- ✅ Set up security policies (RLS)
- ✅ Add all payment-related columns
- ✅ Make you an admin user

### 2️⃣ **THEN: Test Your Setup** (5 minutes)

After database is set up:

1. Start your server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open test page in browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080/test-payment-endpoints.html
   ```

3. Click all test buttons to verify everything works

### 3️⃣ **FINALLY: Test Payment Flow** (5 minutes)

1. Go to your website
2. Add items to cart
3. Go to checkout
4. Try placing an order (use COD first)
5. Check if order appears in your profile

## 🆘 Common Questions

### Q: Which file should I run first?

**A:** Follow `DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - it tells you exactly what to do step-by-step.

### Q: Do I need to run fix-orders-table-schema.sql?

**A:** NO! That's only for databases that already have tables. You need to run `create-complete-database-schema.sql` instead.

### Q: How do I know if it worked?

**A:** After running the SQL scripts, you should see 8 tables in your Supabase dashboard under "Table Editor".

### Q: What if I get errors?

**A:** Read the error message carefully. Most common issues are covered in `DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` under "Common Issues".

### Q: Can I skip the RLS policies?

**A:** NO! Without RLS policies, users could see each other's orders and data. This is a security requirement.
